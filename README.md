# TripleDo
This is a very simple script I have put together. It is primarily based on NoPixel's /do command which is 3D. The only distinct difference is that the background of this is not purple like NoPixel but it can be easily edited.

## Installation
1. Download the release.
2. Drag and drop into your server.
3. Ensure it in your server.cfg
